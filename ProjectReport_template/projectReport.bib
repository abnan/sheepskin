author = {Vadim Bulitko and Shelby Carleton and Delia Cormier and Devon Sigurdson and John
Simpson},
title = {Towards Positively Surprising Non-Player Characters in Video Games},
conference = {AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital
Entertainment},
year = {2017},
keywords = {non-playable characters; artificial intelligence; surprising behavior; a-life},
abstract = {Video games often populate their in-game world with numerous ambient non-
playable characters. Manually crafting interesting behaviors for such characters can be
prohibitively expensive. As scripted AI gets re-used across multiple characters, they can appear
overly similar, shallow and generally uninteresting for the player to interact with. In this paper
we propose to evolve interesting behaviors in a simulated evolutionary environment. Since only
some evolution runs may give rise to such behaviors, we propose to train deep neural networks
to detect such behaviors. The paper presents work in progress in this direction.},
